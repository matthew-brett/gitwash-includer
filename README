==================
 Gitwash-includer
==================

This was a tiny project to show how to include an early version of gitwash_ in
your own project.  This approach used a git merge-tree strategy.  After a little
bit of thinking, we rethought gitwash a bit and went for another approach, so
this method became defunct for gitwash.  If you really want to see how it
worked, then checkout the ``actual-master`` branch in this repo.

The way it currently works in gitwash is by using a script in the gitwash repo,
called ``gitwash_dumper.py``, to process the gitwash files and push them into
your own repo with your project name and other details.
